# TinyPlannr -- The Tiniest Todo App and Planner

## *What Is It?*
This repo is the API. It's mostly a project I'm using to learn how to assemble a REST API using Golang, minus
the benefits of a real framework.

## *Language*
All Go, all the time.

## *Deployment*
_Coming soon..._

## *Notes*
I took a small web tutorial on how to work a JSON API out using Go, and really just kind of ran with it. The way it is
currently written, it is extremely difficult to figure out _how_ to test, let alone go back and bolt testing onto the
whole thing. V2 is going to be me rebuilding the thing in a better and more TDD way.
